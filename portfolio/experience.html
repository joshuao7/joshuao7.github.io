    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Work Experience</h2>
    <p>I have held many roles and tried many industries ranging from Real Estate, hospitality, construction, health, food, and transportation. My love for helping people and solving problems have stayed consistent throughout the years and I am excited to find somewhere where I can continue in that pursuit. I believe that my experience in these other roles will be valuable in whatever role I find as a programmer. After almost 2 years at The College of Western Idaho, I have learned various programming languages, developed problem-solving skills, and now understand how to create functional and efficient software applications. The program taught a comprehensive blend of theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience. The balanced approach has prepared me to enter this industry with the skills and experience to thrive in a variety of roles.</p>
